              Founded in November 2024 by a team of 3 enthusiasts, the company began as a advisory agent for travellers by helping direct them to
              vacation websites according to their needs. Over the years, the team has thought of a way to reach all target audiences that are looking
              to travel more broadly within North America and beyond and in a way that offers better alternatives compared to current offerings. The
              company formed to ensure customers get value for what they pay for and to have a better vacation experience.
